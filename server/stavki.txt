Nice to meet you, Chad
Hi, Stephen, I am Chad
Where are you from
What do you do
What does she do
What do you do, Cathleen
I work at the university as a financial specialist
I love to read and to garden
I picked two buckets of tomatoes last week
What is your phone number
It would be great to meet up again sometime
Letâ€™s keep in touch
Do you have Facebook
Thanks so much for driving me home
Thanks so much for cooking dinner
I really appreciate your help
I am sorry
I am really sorry I did not invite you to the party
Actions speak louder than words
Hope springs eternal
