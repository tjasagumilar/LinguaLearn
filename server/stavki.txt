Nice to meet you, Chad
Hi, Stephen, I am Chad
Where are you from
What do you do
What does she do
What do you do, Cathleen
I work at the university as a financial specialist
I love to read and to garden
I picked two buckets of tomatoes last week
What is your phone number
It would be great to meet up again sometime
Let’s keep in touch
Do you have Facebook
Thanks so much for driving me home
Thanks so much for cooking dinner
I really appreciate your help
I am sorry
I am really sorry I did not invite you to the party
Actions speak louder than words
Hope springs eternal
